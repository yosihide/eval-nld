This code evaluates nonlocal dependency identification accuracy using the metric proposed in Johnson (2002).

This code provides two functions: read-trees and eval-nld.
The following is a sample code:

(let ((gold-trees (read-trees "/corpus/gold.mrg"))
      (test-trees (read-trees "/data/test.mrg")))
  (eval-nld gold-trees test-trees :target :full))

The function read-trees reads a PTB-formatted file and converts the trees into a tree list which the function eval-nld can receive.
The function eval-nld receives a gold tree list and a test tree list.
The keyword :target can take the following values:
:full is a standard evaluation.
:dependency excludes unindexed empty elements.
:empty-element ignores fillers.
:empty-terminal ignores fillers and empty element categories.
